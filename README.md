## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CENGTOKSOY/VivaToUR.git
cd VivaToUR
```

### 2️⃣ Database Setup
- Install PostgreSQL
- Create a new database (e.g., `vivatour_db`)
- Import the provided SQL file (if available)
- Update database credentials inside the configuration file (e.g., `config.php`)

Example configuration:
```php
$host = "localhost";
$dbname = "vivatour_db";
$user = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Project

You can run the project using:
- **XAMPP / MAMP**
- **PHP built-in server:**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Users browse available tours
2. Filters dynamically update tour listings using AJAX
3. Users select a tour and proceed with reservation
4. Payment flow is processed
5. Reservation details are stored in the PostgreSQL database

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

VivaToUR was developed to:
- Demonstrate full-stack web development skills
- Implement real-world booking logic
- Integrate database-driven dynamic filtering
- Practice asynchronous request handling with AJAX
- Build a scalable backend structure using PHP

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Database queries should use prepared statements
- Input validation and sanitization are recommended
- Payment workflows should be secured in production
- Environment variables should be used for sensitive data

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- [ ] Admin dashboard for tour management
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Role-based authorization
- [ ] Real payment gateway integration
- [ ] REST API structure
- [ ] Deployment to cloud (AWS / Azure)
